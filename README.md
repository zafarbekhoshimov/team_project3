## 📌 Objective
Classification 

## CNC Milling Machine
The given dataset, CNC Mill Tool Wear data, was provided for conducting classification studies related to two tasks: 
'Tool wear detection' and 'Detection of inadequate clamping'. The objective is to build models that can accurately classify instances in 
the dataset to identify tool wear and detect cases where clamping is not adequate. These tasks involve training classifiers using the 
provided data to predict and classify instances based on the presence or absence of tool wear and inadequate clamping, respectively.

## 📊 Data
The System-level Manufacturing and Automation Research Testbed (SMART) at the University of Michigan conducted a series 
of machining experiments using 2" x 2" x 1.5" wax blocks on a CNC milling machine. 
Throughout the experiments, data on tool condition, feed rate, and clamping pressure was gathered from the CNC machine.

## 📁 Model
The model in this project is developed using scikit-learn library and scikit-learn models. 
Additionally, we implemented deep-learning technique to check the performance of our model.

## 🛠️ Tools
Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## 📎 Evaluation
The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as f1_score, recall_score, precision_score, accuracy_score, roc_auc_score.
